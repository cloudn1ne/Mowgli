## This code is now pretty much obsolete, better use the [ROS USB Node](../stm32/ros_usbnode) approach

## HowTo

- Flash the [Mowgli STM32 code](./stm32/Mowgli/) using Platform IO and an ST Link (Platform IO Project is setup for an ST Link already)
- You will need something that can run python3 and has pygame installed. I use a Mac or a Raspi will work fine too.
- Wire your serial adapter (or Raspi) to the serial port on the GForce board.
   I used the J18 (Red connector on the mainboard) because the connector from J5 (Signal will fit) and i dont need the signal sense board anymore.
   Maybe something like a Yeonho connector 2.0 mm pitch with lock (SCT2006) fits as well, but i dont have them yet.
   As the pins are unfortunatly in the wrong place on the original J5 connector i used a sharp pick tool to relocate the pins as in the image below.

   You need to short out the connectors on the control(LED + Buttons) board and have that plugged into the mainboard.

   You can then send messages (see Python Joystick example) to the STM32 which will pass them along to either the Blade Motor Controller or the Drive Motors Controller.
